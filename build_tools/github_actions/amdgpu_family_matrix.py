"""
AMD GPU Family Matrix and runner selection utilities for GitHub workflows.

Architecture:
- SUPPORTED BUILD ARCHITECTURES are defined locally in this file (TheRock repo).
  This is the source of truth for what GPU families can be built.
- CI RUNNER CONFIGURATION is loaded from external config when available
  (https://github.com/ROCm/therock-ci-config). This only provides runner labels
  (test-runs-on, etc.) for where tests can actually be executed.

The external config overlays runner labels onto the local architecture definitions.
A family can exist for building even without CI runners configured for testing.

Trigger-based build and test selection:
- Each family specifies `builds_on_trigger` and `tests_on_trigger` lists
- Trigger types: presubmit, postsubmit, submodule_bump, nightly
- workflow_dispatch (on_demand) implicitly allows all families
- Families are included in builds when any active trigger is in builds_on_trigger
- Tests run when any active trigger is in tests_on_trigger
